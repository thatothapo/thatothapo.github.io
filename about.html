        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Thato Thapo. I grew up in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa, one of the most historically significant areas in the country, which has a ton of culture. I recently submitted my M.Sc. thesis in Applied Mathematics focusing on Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cape Town. My M.Sc. project was the Carroll limit of General Relativity , this is an ultra-relativisitic limit antithetical to the Galilean limit, more about this project can be found (here). Before my masters, I worked on Numerical Relativity in my final Honours project. The goal here was to understand the mass-radius relation of neutron stars in a modified theory of gravity, more about it (here).

            My current research interests are quite broad, and cover a wide range of physics topics. I am interested in the study of Machine Learning in Physics. I came across Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and they have occupied my time for a few months. I am definitely still interested in Cosmology however, a few Quantum Gravity ideas have piqued my interest as well as incorparating Machine Learning in General Relativity. I have studied the Early Universe quite a bit in my masters and there are many avenues left to explore (especially with understanding inflation). I am also looking to dive deeper into the theory of spin-2 particles as I have been reading up on that a lot lately. Mostly, any idea beyond the Standard Model will forever be of interest to me, I would love to work in that realm of physics.

            I am also passionate about science outreach and teaching. I have been involved in various outreach programs and initiatives to promote science education and awareness in South Africa. I was chairperson of the Golden Future Project which is an outreach tutoring society to assist learners from underpriviledged high schools with their academics as well as provide computer literacy lessons. Checkout my (full CV) for more on the activities I have been involved with.

            At my leisure, I enjoy playing tabletop games as well as some five-aside football. I have been a part of the Rowing and Table Tennis clubs at UCT and I have continued as a casual enjoyer. I am a huge comicbook fan, and lifelong fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But most of all, I love physics and science in general, and this webpage is to showcase my journey in science sa far. If you want to get in touch, for collaborations, or in need of a tutor or whatever reason, you can find my contact details below.
