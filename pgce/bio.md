## About Me

My name is Thato Thapo. I grew up in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. I hold a B.Sc. in Physics and Applied Mathematics with an Honours in Applied Mathematics. I have also completed an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics focusing on Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cape Town as a recipient of the Exness Fintech Scholarship. I am currently doing a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, specializing in teaching Mathematics as well as research in Math Education.

My research interests are quite broad. I have worked in Theoretical and Computational Cosmology, as well as a few theories in physics beyond the Standard Model. I am interested in Machine Learning in Physics as well as some theories of Quantum Gravity, and in mathematics education, I am currently studying how learners in the senior phase learn to understand algebraic expressions.

I have been involved in various outreach programs and initiatives to promote science education and awareness in South Africa. I was chairperson of the Golden Future Project, which is an outreach tutoring society to assist learners from underprivileged high schools with their academics, as well as provide computer literacy lessons.
