## About Me

My name is Thato Thapo. I grew up in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa. I have an M.Sc. degree in Applied Mathematics focusing on Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cape Town. My M.Sc. project was the Carroll limit of General Relativity , this is an ultra-relativisitic limit antithetical to the Galilean limit. Before my masters, I worked on Numerical Relativity in my final Honours project. The goal here was to understand the mass-radius relation of neutron stars in a modified theory of gravity, you can read further about these in the <a href="{{ '/projects'}}" target="_blank">projects</a> page.

I have a wide range of research interest beyond Classical Cosmology and General Relativity. I have explored a few ideas Conformal Gravity as well as some theories of Quantum Gravity. I have a vested interest in studying Machine Learning in Physics and how particular techniques can open doors to theories beyond General Relativity or the Standard Model. I have also studied the Early Universe extensively so there are still various avenues left to explore there.

I am also passionate about science outreach and teaching. I have been involved in various outreach programs and initiatives to promote science education and awareness in South Africa. I was chairperson of the Golden Future Project which is an outreach tutoring society to assist learners from underpriviledged high schools with their academics as well as provide computer literacy lessons.

This site is to showcase my journey in science so far. If you want to get in touch, for collaborations, or in need of a tutor or whatever reason, you can find my contact details below.
